# cuur
Cuur is an alternative to Nix but the extra features is instead of the Nix package manager it uses the system package manager. You can also use AUR and AUR helpers.

# Installation
You can get Cuur from [here](https://github.com/byTheInK/cuur/releases). Pick the correct package for your operating system or distribution. For Debian pick `.deb`, for Fedora `.rpm` and for Windows `.exe'.

## Building from source
You can check out [here](./media/markdown/build.md) to get the development version.

# Examples
You can use both `Toml` and `Yaml` for this file. I recommend you using a Toml file but if you prefer, you can use a `Yaml` file.
